Introduction
============

This repository demonstrates how to use **Sphinx** for building documentation in two formats:

- A **multi-page** document intended for detailed documentation and printable PDFs.
- A **single-page** document designed for fast reference.

You can build the documents in both **HTML** and **PDF** formats using the provided `Makefile`.

This guide walks you through the setup, customization, and generation process.
